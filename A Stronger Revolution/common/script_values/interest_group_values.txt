# These values are evaluated in a country scope.
# There are some event targets that can be references that describe some
# characteristics of the character that is being created:
#
# - scope:role describes the role of the character. Can be "flag:general", "flag:admiral", or "flag:politician"
# - scope:is_monarch is "yes" if the character is the heir or the ruler of a country with hereditary rule, "no" otherwise
#
# For example, if we wanted to forbid generals to come from the devout ig we could write
# ig_weight_devout = {
#     type = integer
#     value = X # doesn't really matter in this example
#
#     if = {
#         limit = { scope:role = flag:general }
#         value = 0
#     }
# }
